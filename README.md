# üèó The C.Scale‚Ñ¢ Data Model

C.Scale is a stateless API for calculation whole life carbon emissions from the construction, renovation, and operation of buildings. **When highly-detailed energy modeling and life cycle assessment isn't affordable or practicable, teams use C.Scale.**&#x20;

The model allows a user to enter a strict minimum of project parameters to test a wide range of the most meaningful carbon reductions strategies. It is used to power web applications and research focused on both forward-looking planning and retrospective analysis of carbon emissions from buildings and the built environment.
