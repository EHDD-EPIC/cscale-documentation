# üîì Data Privacy Statement

C.Scale values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information when you use our C.Scale web application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and secure your data. By using C.Scale, you acknowledge and accept the terms outlined in this policy.

This policy may be updated periodically, and we will inform you of significant changes by updating the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date and posting the revised policy on this page.

### 2. Information We Collect

We collect several types of information to improve your experience with C.Scale. The first type is personal information, which includes details you provide to create an account, such as your name and email address. This information helps us manage your account and facilitate communication with you.

Additionally, we collect non-identifiable usage data through tools like Google Analytics and Mixpanel. This usage data allows us to analyze how users interact with C.Scale, such as which pages are visited and which features are used. These insights help us to make informed improvements to C.Scale and better support user needs.

Finally, we handle project data that you upload to C.Scale, which is securely stored and anonymized to protect your privacy. Project data is not connected to any personally identifying information and is accessible only to authorized C.Scale personnel for occasional database maintenance tasks.&#x20;

### 3. Use of Your Information

The information we collect is used for purposes that directly benefit your interaction with C.Scale. We use your data to create and manage your account, communicate important updates, and support technical maintenance. Usage data specifically enables us to assess the functionality and performance of C.Scale, ensuring it remains effective and reliable. When you contact us with questions, we may reference your user data to provide timely assistance and resolve issues efficiently.

In cases of security notifications or mandatory service updates, we will reach out to you directly to ensure you are informed of any critical changes affecting C.Scale.

### 4. Data Storage and Security

All data collected through C.Scale is stored on secure servers in the United States. Our data security measures include SSL/TLS encryption for data transmissions and AES-256 encryption for data at rest within MongoDB Atlas, our database provider. These security protocols are further supported by AWS‚Äôs multi-layered protection and a dedicated firewall, ensuring that data remains secure against unauthorized access.

Our user management and authentication provider (Clerk) adheres to SOC 2 Type II and GDPR standards. Only authorized personnel have controlled access to any raw data, allowing us to perform necessary maintenance without compromising privacy. Throughout the organization, we maintain a strict "principle of least privilege" approach to handling any sensitive data.

C.Scale's complete security policy is available for review, which can be requested by contacting [privacypolicy@cscale.io](mailto:privacypolicy@cscale.io).&#x20;

### 5. Data Retention

We retain data for various periods based on its type and purpose. Account data, for example, is retained for up to 30 days after an account is deleted to allow for recovery if needed. Usage data, as handled by our analytics tools, follows the retention standards set by Google Analytics and Mixpanel. Project data is stored only as long as necessary for maintenance and functional improvements within C.Scale.

This approach allows us to balance data retention needs with privacy considerations, ensuring we store data only as long as it directly benefits C.Scale‚Äôs operation and your user experience.

### 6. Your Privacy Rights

You have the right to access your data upon request. If you would like a copy of your data, please contact us at [privacypolicy@cscale.io](mailto:privacypolicy@cscale.io), and we will provide it in a secure format.

For California residents, this Privacy Policy aligns with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), granting you the right to inquire about personal data collection, request deletion, and opt out of data sales. While we do not sell personal data, we are committed to honoring all applicable rights for California residents.

Additionally, C.Scale respects ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù settings, and we do not track user activities or plant cookies if this setting is enabled in your browser.

### 7. Third-Party Services

To understand and improve C.Scale‚Äôs functionality, we use third-party tools such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel. Google Analytics helps us evaluate website usage patterns, and Mixpanel enables us to understand user interactions within the application. You can opt out of Google Analytics by using their Opt-Out Browser Add-on.

These third-party services support our commitment to optimizing C.Scale for a better user experience. However, we ensure they do not collect personal information beyond what is essential for analysis and improvement.

### 8. Children‚Äôs Privacy

C.Scale is not designed for individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided personal data, we will promptly delete this information to maintain compliance with relevant privacy laws.

### 9. Contact Information

For questions, concerns, or requests about this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please reach out to us at [privacypolicy@cscale.io](mailto:privacypolicy@cscale.io).

### 10. Updates to This Policy

We may periodically update this policy to reflect changes in our data practices or applicable laws. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we will revise the ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date to indicate the latest version.
