# üèóÔ∏è How do I use C.Scale?

### Basic Workflow

In C.Scale, the basic workflow is:

1. [Create a Project](create-a-project/)&#x20;
2. [Set a Baseline](set-a-baseline.md)
3. [Reduce Emissions](reduce-emissions/)
4. [Compare Scenarios](compare-scenarios.md)

### Important definitions

* A **Project** includes a baseline and one or more decarbonization scenarios.
* A **Baseline** is a scenario for a project where no attempts have been made to reduce carbon emissions. To define a baseline, C.Scale makes a set of "business as usual" assumptions based on user inputs. When C.Scale's "business as usual" assumptions are not appropriate, they can be refined.
* A **Scenario** is a set of strategies to lower a project's carbon emissions. Scenarios are constructed individually and compared against one another in the [Compare Scenarios](compare-scenarios.md) tab.

### The C.Scale data model

The C.Scale app is powered by the [C.Scale](https://www.cscale.io) data model.
