# Analyze Scenarios

This chart breaks down the building's contribution to operational carbon emissions (B6), embodied carbon emissions (A1-A3, A4-A5, B1, B2-B5, C1-C4, D), and biogenic carbon storage by LCA Stage. This figure represents the total cumulative emissions associated with the scenario across the entire analysis period.

When comparing EPIC results to wbLCA results at later project phases, this breakdown can be helpful in confirming if designs are within the carbon budget for a particular LCA stage for the project as a whole.&#x20;

Comparing the relative contribution of each LCA stage can help in identifying when emissions occur in the lifecycle and targeting reduction strategies accordingly.</p></figcaption></figure>

Each of the LCA stages breaks carbon emissions into the following scope categories:

* **Energy Use**. Sources and use of energy in the building.
* **Structure**. Substructure and superstructure, including both lateral and gravity systems.
* **Enclosure**. Opaque enclosure, transparent enclosure, and roofing.
* **Interior**. Interior construction and fit-out.
* **Services**. **M**echanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) services and PV Array.
* **Refrigerants**. Refrigerants used in building services (e.g., HVAC+R).
* **Sitework**. Hardscape and landscape surrounding the building.
* **Jobsite**. Construction-related processes.
* **Biogenic Carbon Storage**. Total carbon stored by biological materials.

### Summary Chart

This donut chart displays the proportional relationship of the scenario's emissions over the analysis period.&#x20;

This chart has a number of elements:

* **Refrigerant Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the refrigerant use in the building services.&#x20;
* **Electricity Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with the energy use from the electrical grid.&#x20;
* **Fossil Fuel Emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with onsite fossil fuel use.&#x20;
* **Embodied carbon emissions**. Cumulative emissions associated with building materials, their replacements, and with landscape maintenance.
* **Biogenic Carbon Storage**. Sequestered emissions from building structure and landscape planting.
* **Avoided Energy Emissions**. Avoided emissions from onsite energy generation in excess of use.
* **Net Emissions**. Operational, embodied, and refrigerant emissions minus biogenic carbon storage and and avoided energy emissions.
* **Reduction from Baseline**. Cumulative reduction in emissions of the current scenario as compared to the baseline.
* **Energy Use Intensity (EUI)**. Energy use by the building per area per year.&#x20;
* **Embodied Carbon Intensity (ECI)**. Embodied carbon emissions from the building over the analysis period divided by the building area.
